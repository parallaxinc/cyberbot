This folder contains Python library file(s) for the cyber:bot product.

## Instructions for using python code from this directory with the cyber:bot
 1. Open the [Mu editor](https://codewith.mu/en/download) and set the mode to Micro:bit
 2. In the lower-right corner, click the gear
 3. Click the 'BBC Micro:bit settings' tab
 4. Check the 'Minify Python code before flashing' box
 5. Copy and paste the entire contents of the cyberbot_min.py file into your project (use the _min_ file, the un-minified is too large for the micro:bit!)
 6. Write your code below or copy and paste one of the projects from the [examples folder](https://github.com/parallaxinc/cyberbot/tree/master/examples) below the cyberbot.py code
 7. Flash or load your code to your micro:bit/cyber:bot
